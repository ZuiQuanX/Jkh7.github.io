Javascript has been a brand new programing language that I have recently begun to learn. From what I've used and done with it so far, I can say that I am enjoying it. My career of programming began first with Java. Java is a simple, yet powerful programming language that is great for beginners to learn. It has access to classes, loops, arrays, objects, and various other things that give a programmer access to useful tools without having to worry too much about things like the assembler. Garbage collection was a big thing that I liked about Java and how Java, in general, makes the overall programming process simplier and "almost" pain-free.
