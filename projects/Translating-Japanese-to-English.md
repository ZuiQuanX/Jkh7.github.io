Two of my passions in life are gaming in various forms and the Japanese culture. As I've taken courses in Japanese, I set out to improve my fluency by undertaking a personal translation project of Japanese text. That being said, I chose to translate something relating to my other passion of games: specifically a Japanese card game called ChaOS TCG. The text itself is a comprehensive rule book with 30 pages of never-before-translated Japanese text. My goal with this project is to provide English-users with a decently and unofficially translated rule book for playing the game.

The translation itself is still in progress as of August 28, 2016. I've made significant progress to completing the project with nearly 25% of the text having been translated. To assist my work, I use a combination of Google Translate and a Japanese Online Dictionary site called Jisho.org. Both of these tools have immensly helped me take the text and get an almost-accurate translation of the text. Google Translate however, is by no means perfect. Thus I use Jisho.org to obtain word-by-word translations and using my knowledge of Japanese, I come to an English translation. The rule text is made to be as comprehensive as possible for the Japanese card game and so it has many sections that are hard to translate. I am confident however, that I will finish this translation by December of this year.
