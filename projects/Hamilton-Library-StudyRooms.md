This project involved me taking a series of photographs of all the study rooms in the Thomas Hale Hamilton Library. Along with collecting data on the room size, number of chairs, number of outlets, size of the desk, and etc., these were used to give library patrons more information regarding which study room to reserve. This project was done as part of my student job at the Hamilton Library. Since then, patrons have made comments that the site allows them to choose the study room right for them.

During my work shift, I went to each study room and took a panoramic photograph with my smartphone camera. I attempted to get as wide and complete of a view as I could. Then I counted up the number of items in the room, noted the sizes, took note of miscellaneous things and provided this information to my supervisor. The data and photographs I collected are posted up on the Hamilton Library website under Group Study Room Reservations and made available to patrons who come to the front desk and request to know more. Hopefully this project will last for a long time and help patrons interested in booking study rooms.
