The League of Legends Beginner's Guide was a project I made in my senior year of high school as part of my ITGS class. The aim of the project was to consult with a client to design and implement a real-world application using technology mediums to address either a problem or a desired application. The result of the project was a beginner's guide video to an online video game called League of Legends.

The video was then posted onto Youtube to provide a way for my client to view the video and for others that may be in his shoes, to also view the video.

The video can be viewed below.
